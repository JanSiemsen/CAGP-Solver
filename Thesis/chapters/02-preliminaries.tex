\begin{definition}[Simple polygon]
When given a list of distinct points in the plane, the line segments between consecutive points in the list and the last and first point form the outer boundary of a simple polygon, as long as none of them cross each other. This outer boundary is a Jordan polygonal curve, and together with its interior face, it forms a simple polygon. A simple polygon with holes P, additionally contains one or more smaller simple polygons fully contained in its interior. The interior of these smaller polygons is then considered as the exterior of P.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Visibility polygon]
For a simple polygon P (possibly with holes), two points p, q E P are mutually visible if the line segment between them is fully contained in P. Given a point p E P, p and all points in P visible to it form a simple polygon. We call the polygon visibility polygon of p.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Guard set]
For a simple polygon P (possibly with holes), a guard set G is a set of points in P s.t. all the points in P are contained in at least one of the visibility polygons of G. We call the points of the guard set guards.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Atomic visibility polygon]
When given a guard set G, we can overlay its visibility polygons to form an arrangement. We call the faces of this arrangement atomic visibility polygons.
