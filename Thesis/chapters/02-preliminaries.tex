\chapter{Preliminaries}
If needed, you can write down definitions here, that you need in your thesis.
For this, the definition-environment can be helpful
\begin{definition}[Graph coloring]
	A graph $G=(V,E)$ is $k$-colorable if there is a function $C: V\rightarrow \{1,\dots, k\}$ such that $C(u)\neq C(v)$ for any edge $\{u,v\}\in E$
	
	The \emph{chromatic number} of a graph $G$ is the smallest number $k$ such that $G$ is $k$-colorable.
\end{definition}
