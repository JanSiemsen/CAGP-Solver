\chapter{Preliminaries}
\begin{definition}[Simple polygon]
When given a list of distinct points in the plane, the line segments between consecutive points in the list and the last and first point form the outer boundary of a simple polygon, as long as none of them cross each other. This outer boundary is a Jordan polygonal curve, and together with its interior face, it forms a simple polygon. A simple polygon with holes P, additionally contains one or more smaller simple polygons fully contained in its interior. The interior of these smaller polygons is then considered as the exterior of P.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Visibility polygon]
For a simple polygon P (possibly with holes), two points p, q E P are mutually visible if the line segment between them is fully contained in P. Given a point $p\in P$, p and all points in P visible to it form a simple polygon. We call the polygon visibility polygon of p.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Guard set]
For a simple polygon P (possibly with holes), a guard set G is a set of points in P s.t. all points in P are contained in at least one of the visibility polygons of G. We call the points of the guard set guards.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Atomic visibility polygon (AVP)]
When given a guard set G of a polygon P, we can overlay the visibility polygons of G to form an arrangement. We call the faces of this arrangement atomic visibility polygon (AVP) and denote the set of faces as $\mathcal{F}$. By assigning to each AVP $f\in\mathcal{F}$ the guard subset $G_{f}$ that they were created from, we can form a partial order over the AVPs s.t. for $f,f'\in\mathcal{F}$ $f\prec f'$ if and only if $G_{f}\subsetG_{f'}$. For an AVP $f\in\mathcal{F}$ we call it shadow (light) whenever it is minimal (maximal) within that order.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Witness set]
When given a guard set G of a polygon P, a witness set W is a set of points inside P that must be covered by G. W is called a shadow witness set when it consists of a point within each shadow AVP of G. We call these points shadow witnesses.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[2-link-visibility graph]
For a guard set G of a polygon P, the 2-link-visibility graph $G_{vis}$ has a vertex for each guard and an edge between two guard vertices whenever their visibility polygons intersect.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Covering graph]
For a guard set G and a witness set W of a polygon P, the covering graph $G_{cov}$ has a vertex for each guard in G and each witness in W and an edge between a guard and a witness whenever the witness is contained in the visibility region of that guard.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Chromatic Art Gallery Problem]
For a guard set G and a witness set W of a polygon P, the Chromatic Art Gallery Problem looks for minimum proper coloring among all subgraphs $G_{sub}$ of $G_{vis}$ s.t. each witness vertex in $G_{cov}$ has a guard vertex in its neighborhood that is contained in $G_{sub}$.
\end{definition}

For a guard set G and a witness set W of a polygon P,
