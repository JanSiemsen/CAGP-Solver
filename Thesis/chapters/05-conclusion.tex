\chapter{Conclusion (and Future Work)}

-designed SAT formulation and color optimization scheme
-implemented MIP, SAT, and CP-SAT for CAGP
-designed MIP and SAT formulation for CFCAGP
-implemented MIP and SAT for CFCAGP

-did tests on random simple polygons with and without holes
-SAT turned out to be much better on simple polygons without holes as well as better on with holes

Future Work:
-find a better Heuristic for CFCAGP for lower Initial Bound
-try to find a small AVP subset that guarantees conflict-freeness or prove that no such set exists
-potentially improve MIP or SAT formulation for the CFCAGP
