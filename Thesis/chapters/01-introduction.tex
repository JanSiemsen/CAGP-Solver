\chapter{Introduction}
The chromatic art gallery problem (CAGP) was first introduced by Erickson and LaValle in 2010 ~\cite{erickson2010chromatic}. The problem involves finding a guard set that covers the entirety of a given polygon P, requiring the smallest number of colors to color the guards such that the visibility regions of guards with the same color do not overlap. This minimum number of colors is called the ``chromatic guard number'' $\chi_G(P)$. Another closely related problem is the conflict-free chromatic art gallery problem (CFCAGP), where the goal is for each point in the polygon to have at least one guard with a distinct color among the guards visible to that point ~\cite{bartschi2014conflict}. For both problems, finding a guard set that satisfies the constraints has been established to be NP-hard even when limiting oneself to the set of candidate guards being the vertices of the polygon ~\cite{fekete2014chromatic}~\cite{erickson2011many}~\cite{iwamoto2022vertex}. In this context, we will explore finding exact solutions using MIP, SAT, and CP-SAT Solver.

\section{Related Work}
The complexity of the chromatic art gallery problem has been subject of several papers covering different classes of polygons.
For a polygon with holes, it is NP-hard to decide if a fixed number $k \geq 2$ of colors is sufficient ~\cite{fekete2014complexity}. Similarly, computing the minimum number of colors needed to cover a simple polygon is NP-hard for $\Theta(n)$ colors ~\cite{fekete2014complexity}, and the same holds when limiting ourselves to arbitrary guard positions ~\cite{fekete2014chromatic}. When it comes to covering an orthogonal polygon, deciding whether a fixed number $k \geq 2$ of colors is sufficient is also NP-hard ~\cite{hoorfar2021np}.\par\noindent
However, given a polygon $P$ and a guard set $S$ of $P$, it is possible to compute an optimal coloring of $S$ so that no two members of $S$ with the same color have overlapping visibility regions in polynomial time ~\cite{erickson2011many}. For a simple polygon $P$ and a discrete set of candidate guard locations, there exists a polynomial time algorithm to compute an optimal $2$-colorable guard set considering various objectives ~\cite{fekete2014chromatic}. Additionally, for a simple polygon $P$ and a discrete set of candidate guard locations, there is an $\mathcal{O}(\log (\chi_G(P)))$-approximation algorithm that runs in polynomial time ~\cite{fekete2014chromatic}. There is also a $6$-approximation algorithm for simple orthogonal polygons with linear time and space complexity, as well as an exact algorithm for histogram polygons that runs in linear time \cite{hoorfar2021np}.\par\noindent
Since the problem remains NP-hard for most polygon classes, one might consider looking for lower and upper bounds on the problem.
In the following, we consider a few lower bounds.
For $k \geq 3$ exists a polygon $P_k$ with $4k$ vertices and $\chi_G(P_k) \geq k$ ~\cite{erickson2012art}.
For $k$ exists a polygon $P_k$ with $3k$ vertices and $\chi_G(P_k) \geq k/2$ ~\cite{bartschi2011coloring}.
For $k \geq 3$ exists a strictly monotone polygon $M_k$ with $3k^2$ vertices and $\chi_G(M_k) \geq k$ ~\cite{erickson2012art}.
For $k \geq 3$ and odd exists a monotone orthogonal polygon $R_k$ with $4k^2 + 10k + 10$ vertices and $\chi_G(R_k) \geq k$ ~\cite{erickson2012art}.
For $k$ exists a monotone orthogonal polygon $R_k$ with $4k^2$ vertices and $\chi_G(R_k) \geq k/4$ ~\cite{bartschi2011coloring}.\par\noindent
In the following, we consider a few upper bounds.
For any monotone, orthogonal or general polygon $P_n$ with n vertices $\chi_G(P_n) = \mathcal{O}(n)$ ~\cite{bartschi2011coloring}.
For any spiral polygon $P_{spi}$ $\chi_G(P_{spi}) \leq 2$ ~\cite{erickson2012art}.
For any staircase polygon $P_{sta}$: $\chi_G(P_{sta}) \leq 3$ ~\cite{erickson2012art}.\par\noindent
The only paper that has addressed practically solving the chromatic art gallery problem so far is by de Souza et al. The paper proposes a MIP formulation of the problem and provides practical results on it ~\cite{zambon2014exact}. The MIP solver used in this thesis is based on the approach presented in that paper.\par\noindent
Now looking at the conflict-free chromatic art gallery problem, there has only been one paper considering its complexity so far.
For a polygon with holes, determining whether there exists a conflict-free chromatic vertex guard set with $2$ colors is NP-hard ~\cite{iwamoto2022vertex}.\par\noindent
As for lower and upper bounds, the following upper bounds were discovered.
For any monotone polygon $P_n$ with n vertices $\chi_{cfG}(P_n) = \mathcal{O}(\log n)$ ~\cite{bartschi2011coloring}.
For any orthogonal polygon $P_n$ with n vertices $\chi_{cfG}(P_n) = \mathcal{O}(\log n)$ ~\cite{bartschi2011coloring}.
For any polygon $P_n$ with n vertices $\chi_{cfG}(P_n) = \mathcal{O}((\log n)^2)$ ~\cite{bartschi2011coloring}.
As for practically solving the conflict-free chromatic art gallery problem, there have been no publications as of date and this thesis provides a first attempt at doing so.
