\section{Experiment Environment}
All geometric operations were implemented using the C++ library CGAL. The visibility graph creation as well as all solvers were implemented in Python (version 3.10.14). For the MIP solvers, we used Gurobi (gurobipy version 11.0.1). The SAT solvers were implemented using PySAT (python-sat version 0.1.8.dev9). Lastly, the CP-SAT solvers were implemented with OR-tools CP-SAT solver (ortools version 9.9.3963).
The benchmarks were run in WSL2 (Windows 11, version 22H2) using an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 8-Core Processor 4.20 GHz and the WSL was assigned 28 GB of RAM.

\section{SAT Solver Choice}
PySAT provides several different SAT solvers. That is why in this section, we will compare them against each other to determine, which one performs the best on our model. Additionally, we will compare using the clauses \cref{eq:_SATf.3} (version 1) against leaving them out and filtering the solution afterward as described in the SAT Color Optimization chapter (version 2). Due to the parameter sets becoming quite large when comparing all of the SAT solvers, we filtered out a few that performed poorly during testing beforehand.
