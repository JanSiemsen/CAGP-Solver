\section{Experiment environment}
All geometric operations were implemented using the C++ library CGAL. The visibility graph creation as well as all solvers were implemented in Python. As a MIP solver 
If you have experiments, write down:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Implementation details (e.g., libraries, third-party programs, \dots): CGAL, gurobi, pysat, ortools cpsat
	\item In which environment are you testing (e.g., system specifications): AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 8-Core Processor 4.20 GHz, 32.0 GB RAM
	\item What are you testing? (e.g., runtime, space needed, fps, \dots): runtime
	\item What are the results? Show fancy figures!
	\item What does the results mean? (e.g., give a little discussion on your results)
	\item \dots
\end{itemize}
