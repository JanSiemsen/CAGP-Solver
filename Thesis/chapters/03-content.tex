\chapter{Content}

From here, start your main content. You can always use new chapters if needed.
Use proper environments for your content, e.g. theorem, definition, lemma, etc.
Here are some examples.


\begin{theorem}
	Every planar graph is 4-colorable.
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}
	Every bipartite graph is 2-colorable.
\end{lemma}
\begin{corollary}
	Every tree graph is 2-colorable.
\end{corollary}
Because graphs with at least one edge need at least two colors, we obtain the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}
	The chromatic number of every (non-trivial) bipartite graph is 2.
\end{theorem}
