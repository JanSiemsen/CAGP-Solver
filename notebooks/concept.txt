1. determine a guard set
2. determine a witness set
3. calculate the graph Gc for every guard a vertex 
and an edge if the visibility polygons overlap
4. calculate the graph Gw for every guard a vertex and witness a vertex 
and an edge between them if the witness is inside the visibility polygon of the guard
5. calculate the graph Gt; the union of Gc and Gw
